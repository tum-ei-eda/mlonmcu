## Features

- Highly configurable python package
- Automatic resolution and installation of dependencies
- Supporting a large combination of frameworks/backends/targets/features
- Build-in parallel processing of large number of benchmarks
- Isolated enironments (not interfering with other installations)
- Command Line and Python Development Interfaces
- Docker images to get started quickly
- Extensive documentation on usage and code details
- CI/CD integration and high PyTest coverage

## Getting started

#### Connan Commands (MINRES only)

```sh
curl -sfL https://direnv.net/install.sh | bash
which direnv
curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
source $HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh
sdk version
sdk install java 11.0.21-tem
pip3 install 'conan<2.0
conan profile new --detect default
conan remote add gitea https://git.minres.com/api/packages/Tooling/conan
```

### Prerequisites

#### Ubuntu/Debian

First, a set of APT packages needs to be installed:

```
# Python related
sudo apt install python3-pip python3-venv

# MLonMCU related
sudo apt install libboost-all-dev graphviz doxygen libtinfo-dev zlib1g-dev texinfo unzip device-tree-compiler tree g++

# Optional (depending on configuration)
sudo apt install ninja-build flex lsb-release libelf-dev
```

Also make sure that your default Python is at least v3.7. If the `python` command is not available in your shell or points Python v2.7 check out `python-is-python3`.


Make sure to use a fresh virtual Python environment in the following steps.

#### Build Package manually

First, install all relevant dependencies:

```
python -m venv .venv  # Feel free to choose a different directory or use a conda environment

# Run this whenever your have updated the repository
source .venv/bin/activate

git clone -b develop https://github.com/Minres/mlonmcu.git

# Environment-specific dependencies are installed later

**Warning:** It is recommended to have at least version 3.20 of CMake installed for full compatibility!

# Install ptional dependecies (only for development)
pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
pip install -r docs/requirements.txt

# Only if you want to use the provided python notebooks, as explained in  ./ipynb/README.md
pip install -r ipynb/requirements.txt
```

Then you should be able to install the `mlonmcu` python package like this

```
# Optionally remove an older version first: pip uninstall mlonmcu

make install  # Alternative: python setup.py install
```
### Usage

Is is recommended to checkout the provided [Demo Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/tum-ei-eda/mlonmcu/blob/main/ipynb/Demo.ipynb) as it contains a end-to-end example which should help to understand the main concepts and methodology of the tool. The following paragraphs can be seen as a TL;DL version of the information in that Demo notebook.

While some tools and features of this project work out of the box, some of them require setting up an environment where additional dependencies are installed. This can be achived by creating a MLonMCU environment as follows:

```bash
mlonmcu init --name <environment_name> --template tgc # this creates a mlonmcu environment
```

Now you have to point the environment variable to your environment
```bash
export MLONMCU_HOME=<path_to_your_environment_variable>
mlonmcu env # this command lists all your available environments
```

The next step can take some time
```bash
mlonmmcu setup -g # creates a requirements.txt file for your environment
pip install -r $MLONMCU_HOME/requirements_addition.txt
#the tgc iss needs cmake version 3.20 so make sure the necessary version is loaded before running mlonmcu setup
module load ./Modulefile
mlonmcu setup
```
Now you are ready to go. For Usage it is best to checkout the Demo Jupyter notebook. The general flow will be described here.

## List of interesting MLonMCU forks

- MINRES TGC support: https://github.com/Minres/mlonmcu/tree/develop

## List of existing MLonMCU extensions/plugins

- ABC Example Plugin: coming soon!
- MINRES TGC Support: coming soon!

## Development

Make sure to first install the additonal set of development Python packages into your virtual environment:

```
pip install -r requirements_dev.txt  # Building distributions and running tests
pip install -r docs/requirements.txt  # For working with the documentation
```

Unit test and integration test are defined in the `tests/` directory and can be triggered using `make test` or `pytest tests/`

Coverage can be determined by running `make coverage`. The latest coverage report (HTML) for the default branch can also be found as an artifact of the CI/CD workflow.

Documentation is mainly generated automatically from doctrings (triggered via `make html`). It is also possible to include markdown files from the repo into the `.rst` files found in the [`docs/`](./docs/) directory. There is a GitHub workflow which publishes the documentation for the default branch to our [GitHub Pages](https://tum-ei-eda.github.io/mlonmcu).

Regarding coding style, it is recommended to run `black` before every commit. The default line length should be given in the `setup.cfg` file.
